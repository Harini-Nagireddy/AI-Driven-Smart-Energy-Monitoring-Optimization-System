⚡ AI-Driven Smart Energy Monitoring & Optimization System

An intelligent energy analytics system that analyzes household energy usage, predicts future consumption, estimates electricity bills, and provides smart optimization suggestions to reduce energy costs.

This project combines Data Analytics + Machine Learning + Automation to help users understand and optimize their electricity consumption.

🚀 Key Features
📊 Energy Usage Analysis

Analyzes historical household power consumption data to identify patterns and trends in energy usage.

🔮 Future Energy Prediction

Uses machine learning models to forecast next month’s energy consumption based on past usage.

💰 Electricity Bill Estimation

Estimates upcoming electricity bills using predicted energy usage and tariff rates.

⚙️ Energy Optimization Suggestions

Provides intelligent recommendations such as:

Reducing excessive appliance usage

Switching to energy-efficient alternatives

Adjusting usage patterns to lower monthly bills

📈 Data-Driven Insights

Generates appliance-level and behavioral insights to highlight where energy is being wasted.

🧠 How the System Works

Raw household energy data is collected and cleaned

Features are engineered from historical usage patterns

A trained machine learning model predicts future energy consumption

The system estimates the upcoming electricity bill

Optimization logic generates personalized energy-saving suggestions

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data processing
